* librelibrus - An open source Librus Synergia frontend

[[https://ravensiris.github.io/librelibrus/][Project on Github Pages]]

Goal of this project is to free students from the limitations of Librus Synergia software
mainly: giving the user *fresh* information unlike their mobile app that can only
refresh every *3h* or so.

Check out my other projects that were used here: [[https://github.com/ravensiris/librusrestapi][librusrestapi]] & [[https://github.com/ravensiris/librusapi][librusapi]]

* Tech used
- =Vue.js= with =Typescript=, =Vuex=, =Vue Router=, =Stylus=
- [[https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator-cli][OpenAPI Generator]] for quick API client generation with =typescript= and =Axios=
- [[https://github.com/ravensiris/librusrestapi][librusrestapi]] & [[https://github.com/ravensiris/librusapi][librusapi]]

* Running the project

  #+begin_src 
  npm run serve
  #+end_src

* Current caveats
Currently Vue router doesn't work on Github Pages.
Unfortunately [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50175802/deploy-vue-to-github-pages-error-with-vue-router][this]] wouldn't work for me.
Site requires manual navigation from the root page.
